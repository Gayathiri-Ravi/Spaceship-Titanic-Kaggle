# Spaceship-Titanic-Kaggle


Data source : https://www.kaggle.com/

I have created three notebooks.

1. Data_cleansing.ipynb for creating the "clean test.csv" and "clean train.csv" files
2. Analaysis.ipynb for creating "to_machinelearning.csv" file 
3. Machine Learning.ipynb to predict weather a particular passenger would get transported or not.

### Analysis
The data after clenasing was used for analysis and I was able to find some interesting insights. 
Then, I added new features which will further help classify more efficiently. After the feature engineering and Analysis, 
I saved that data, and passed it to the ML models. 

### Machine Learning
I tried ensembling all models, but the Standalone XGB model has given the best score so far.! 

### Results
I was able to achive the Kaggle score of 0.80056
